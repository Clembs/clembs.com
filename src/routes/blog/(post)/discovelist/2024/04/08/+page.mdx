Hi everyone! I'm delighted to announce another week of Discovelist! I'm again changing up the format slightly, never stopping the experimenting until I stick with something I like for a while. This issue came in late because I had to work for a friend/client, while some other events popped up, making me unavailable to write. But that's all right, just pretend this came last Sunday like they always do. 
## Weekly discoveries
As of this issue, I'm merging the "Fresh finds" and "Weekly highlights" sections into one, because I realized this newsletter isn't really about news but more so raw discoveries.

#### Gaming: Crypt of the NecroDancer, mixing dungeons and music
So, this week, I have finally bought [*Crypt of the NecroDancer*](https://braceyourselfgames.com/crypt-of-the-necrodancer/), an indie rogue-like rhythm game with randomly generated dungeons where you need to move, slay and progress in rhythm. I'm only an hour into the game, and I know I'll be spending a lot more exploring everything it has to offer. The game is currently on sale [on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/247080/Crypt_of_the_NecroDancer/) until April 13, and it's recently got Hatsune Miku DLC (because of course this is what got me to get the game) which I also highly recommend.

#### TV/Films: Severance, a realist horror science-fiction series
On Saturday, I've started watching [*Severance*](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/95396), a show following the story of Mark Scott, an employee at a corporation where he has to be severed, AKA having his brain genetically altered so that his work and personal life memories were to be separated. Four episodes in, I can say it is quite good already, very slow-paced so it can be boring for some, but I find that to add realism to an already well constructed universe where this creepy severance issue feels even realer now that it resonates with [modern-day brain chips](https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/21/24107499/neuralink-human-trial-chess-video-brain-computer-interface).

#### Programming: Bun releases on Windows
Last Monday, super fast JavaScript runtime and toolkit [Bun](https://bun.sh) finally released on Windows thanks to many developers, most notably [dave](https://paperdave.net). It is a very great move to attract more developers into their excellent JS suite of tools, though I wasn't a fan of the build up to release: delay after delay, release date after release date, always building up hype then letting everyone down, etc., and the fact that it released with only 98% of tests passing, making me wonder if it hasn't been rushed to satisfy yet another release date. If you're a Node.js developer, I recommend giving it a try anyway!

#### Music: bo en, one of those cool "weird" electro artists
This week, I've discovered [bo en](https://bo-en.info/), or formally [Calum Bowen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_En), a composer who I did apparently know before as he worked on soundtracks for numerous video games such as [*Pikuniku*](https://pikuniku.net/) or [*OMORI*](http://www.omori-game.com/). I listened to *My Time* ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkMLYNWP-yo)) first, and although the English prononciation of Japanese threw me off at first, I stayed for the grandiose, weird and goofy instrumentation (fun fact: [the backup vocals are VOCALOID](https://vocadb.net/S/166726)) and the deep lyrics. I also listened to *Pale Machine 2* ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2q5GEoRZbr62J0sa1N-iTUnrkKUH1ubV)) which reminded me a lot of several artists (definitely [Kikuo](https://kikuo.jp), sometimes [Moe Shop](https://www.moeshop.jp/), a hint of [Shawn Wasabi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE1Gvzxfm1E) and Daft Punk). Insane shit, definitely worth checking out if you recognize any of these people or like weird pop/electro in general.

#### Other discoveries
- [Windhawk](https://windhawk.net/), a "mod loader" for Windows, enabling customization à la [Winaero Tweaker](https://winaero.com/winaero-tweaker/) but in a sleeker interface and more community-focused. Haven't tried yet (I'm on Linux 80% of the time nowadays), but keeping an eye on it.
- [Retro](https://retro.app/), a modern social media focused on sharing memories with friends. One user described it as "*a mix between BeReal and Instagram.*". Not tested yet either, and probably not something I'd use, but they have a good concept that may interest *you*.
- Design software [Figma](https://figma.com) releases [old-school cursors](https://www.figma.com/blog/april-fun-day-cursors/) on their software for what they call "April Fun Day", with Y2K, Aero, Skeumorphic and 8-Bit-inspired cursors. If you have no idea what the aforementioned terms mean, I'd recommend you just check out the link above, it's cool stuff.

## Community corner
You guys were plenty to share your very interesting discoveries this week, and it's once again very varied, which is always so interesting:

Théo (@professordio on Discord) found [*Architectuul*]([https://architectuul.com/](https://architectuul.com/ "https://architectuul.com/")), a repository of buildings, architects and their history:
> i was maxed chillaxed searching for ex-yugoslavia brutalist buildings, like on every tuesday, and suddenly, wouldnt'cha know it, i found a damn well designed website, clear and incredibly jam-packed in information. i was so impressed af i wanted to share it to the amazing clembs' discovelist

Morgan ([@morganlabs](https://github.com/morganlabs)) shared a little article about a very fascinating and dangerous plant named [Jimsonweed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datura_stramonium), but I swear it is more interesting than it sounds:
> Datura Stramonium, also known as Jimsonweed, or other names, is a deliriant drug. It also acts as a poison on the human body. It grows as, what i think, is actually a very pretty flower (picture attached). **All** parts of the plant contain dangerous shit, which, as i said before, can cause severe poisoning to the body if ingested. It can cause insanely vivid hallucinations and, in some extreme case, permanently modify one's mental health and stability.
> 
> The part people take is the seeds of the plant. Any amount could theoretically cause death. In one case, there was this farmer who had dealt with Datura before. When he saw some, I believe he went to pull it out **with gloves on**. Somehow, this alone caused an insane high for him. 
> 
> Another guy took some, and proceeded to watch his wife and daughted being murdered for hours on end, with no way to escape. He described it as "a gif, and it would reset whenever you moved your eyes." A common experience with the drug is being i one location with your eyes open, and another with your eyes closed. Most of the time, you cannot escape the hallucinations until you come down, which can take several days depending on dosage. I believe both of these guys never fully recovered mentally, especially not the latter.

Jules ([julesbernard.com](https://julesbernard.com)) sent me a mini-documentary on cinema named [*Collateral & the Death of Neon*](https://youtu.be/y51VUsotZe4?si=-nJrNCGffcoa2suZ):
> I saw this video which talks about street lights technology and how it affected the looks of movies, and i think it's a pretty interesting relationship
