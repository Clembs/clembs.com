## Overview

This was a project long overdue. Inspired from [Bill
Wurtz](https://billwurtz.com/questions) and my friend [Dave Caruso](https://paperdave.net/q+a), I've
experimented with QnA systems before (see [Anonymous messages](/archive/messages)), but they were
never complete or quite right. I've eventually decided to build a fully-fledged comment system with
an account system, moderation, etc.

### Stack

For the database, I'm relying on
[Supabase](https://supabase.com) for hosting a Postgres instance, and [Drizzle
ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team) as my go-to ORM. Clembs.com being built with
[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev), I decided to use their [form
actions](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/form-actions) feature in order to make the whole system work
without JavaScript (which [still happens](https://kryogenix.org/code/browser/everyonehasjs.html)).
