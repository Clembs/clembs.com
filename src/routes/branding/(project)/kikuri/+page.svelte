<h2>About</h2>

Kikuri is a Discord bot about an anime-themed card-collecting global economy where users collect,
trade, and upgrade their cards, to fight against other users. Kikuri’s team approached me to
redesign their website for mobile and desktop, to make it more content-rich and responsive while
using the brand’s core identity.
