<h2>
	this page is not complete, and actually no other page is. this is a draft to look at what a
	project page would look like, layout-wise.
</h2>

<p>
	I started CRBT in 2019 as my very first coding experiment, and over the years it's become more
	complete and defined, as a true multi-purpose Discord bot.
	<br />
	As the project evolved a lot the past year, its website needed a serious refresh to reflect it, and
	what the future holds for it. Inspired by Material You, the new website features a clean and refined
	design that works on all screen sizes and themes.

<h3>Interactive demo</h3>

<p>
	The multi-purpose Discord bot market being satured, CRBT's website needed to stand out. I opted
	for a way to preview the bot by replicating the typical Discord experience!
</p>

<div class="iframe-wrapper">
	<iframe title="CRBT website" src="https://crbt.app" />
</div>

<h3>Illustrations</h3>

<p>
	The new illustrations feature Microsoft's gorgeous Fluent Emojis and embrace the iconic Discord
	embeds with different hues, representing CRBT's customization capabilities!
