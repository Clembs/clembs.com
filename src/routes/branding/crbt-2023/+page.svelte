<h2>About</h2>

<p>
	I started CRBT in 2019 as my very first coding experiment, and over the years it's become more
	complete and defined, as a true multi-purpose Discord bot.
	<br />
	As the project evolved a lot the past year, its website needed a serious refresh to reflect it, and
	what the future holds for it. Inspired by Material You, the new website features a clean and refined
	design that works on all screen sizes and themes.

<h2>Interactive demo</h2>

<p>
	The multi-purpose Discord bot market being satured, CRBT's website needed to stand out. I opted
	for a way to preview the bot by replicating the typical Discord experience!

<h2>Illustrations</h2>

	The new illustrations feature Microsoft's gorgeous Fluent Emojis and embrace the iconic Discord
	embeds with different hues, representing CRBT's customization capabilities!
