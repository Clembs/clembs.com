		"I started CRBT in 2019 as my very first coding experiment, and over the years it's become more complete and defined, as a true multi-purpose Discord bot.<br>As the project evolved a lot the past year, its website needed a serious refresh to reflect it, and what the future holds for it.<br>Inspired by Material You, the new website features a clean and refined design that works on all screen sizes and themes.",
